<p class="sectionTag text-big">The Ultimate Pilgrimage Spot (Varanasi) </p>
<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">According to Hindu mythology, Varanasi was founded by Shiva,
 one of three principal deities along with Brahma and Vishnu.
  During a conflict between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five heads was torn off by Shiva. As was the custom,
the victor carried the slain adversary's head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy, 
and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. 
Shiva thus dishonoured Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. 
When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. 
Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy site. </p>
